The goal of the project is making information about COVID-19 easily accessible and easy to understand for the public using data visualization. The project features a scatterplot layer which changes colors based of the data point and a heat map layer which is weighted based of the value of the data point. It also features the ability to turn these layers on and off, switch between different data parameters such as confirmed cases or deaths and features a tooltip UI component which appears when the user hovers over an element."

Obtained data from several sensors such as cameras, potentiometers, gyroscopes, encoders, utilized data to design autonomous capabilities using PID control loops. Used Git and GitHub for version control of software and open sourced the software used for the robot with proper documentation and comments within the code. Mentored novice students, teaching proper programming practices, helped with debugging and taught concepts ranging from the basics of programming to synchronous vs asynchronous programming and tools such as GitHub."

The basic idea was to parse the board, create easily modifiable board objects which could be used to create projections and new states and traverse said states using A* until a solved state was found. With powerful A* heurstics and other optimizations we were able to solve the hardest puzzle in 0.125 seconds."

This was the first time I've used Node.js and TypeScript in a project and it was a fun learning experience!"
